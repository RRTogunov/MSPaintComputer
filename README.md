What started as a joke about the worst way to do statistics, turned into an cognitive itch, and side hobby. 

Just posting the logic gates for now, but there's more to come.

Instructions:
1. Define colors for A and B (white = 0, black  = 1). 
2. Using the colour-picker and bucket/fill tools, cycle through copy/pasting the colours in the "Bus" and "Probe" squares on the left into the leads on the right.
Note: when there is more than one colour in the source, cycle through them in order from left to right. 
Tip: press "b" to activate the fill tool, press "i" to activate the colour-picker tool (when you click to select a colour, it will automatically switch back to the fill tool, so you only need to press "b" once at the start)
